\frametitle{OLS Regression Overview}

\item OLS Regression is a method of understanding the relationship between a set of variables. 

\item The basic mathematical framework of OLS Regression is to identify a function that minimizes the sum of 
squared distances between the predicted outputs from a given set of inputs and the real outputs from those same inputs. 

\[\(\beta = (X^TX)^1X^Ty\)\]
